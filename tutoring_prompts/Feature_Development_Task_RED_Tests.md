Act as a world class mobile application architect

# Context

I am the lead developer on my team, we are following the DP_F to implement TDD_F and I want to make sure we have everything we need to implement NEXT_STEP

I want to deliver the best result possible, most importantly clarifying any major points of potential divergence within the plan and gaps in information that could lead to very different interpretations or implementation decisions if they are not specified more clearly. To do this, we want to go with test driven development to define the tests that will demonstrate the behavior required once NEXT_STEP is fully implemented.  

# Criteria

Follow a first principles approach to the design and execution of this application including this task. Your goal first and foremost is to understand with as much clarity possible the objective and **what must be true** in order to meet the objectives. Everything else is a distraction. 

## Make your requirements less dumb.
- Most errors come from bad assumptions that were never challenged.
- Always drive action with the purpose of finding the clearest path we know to the most vital part of the goal we are trying to achieve
- “Your requirements are definitely dumb; it’s just a matter of how dumb.”

## Try very hard to delete parts of the process or product.
- If something is not absolutely necessary, remove it.
- “If you’re not occasionally adding things back in, you’re not deleting enough.”
- Simplicity is a feature. Complexity is a bug.

## Optimize the design only after doing steps 1 and 2.
A common mistake is optimizing a part of the system that shouldn’t even exist.
Don’t fall into the trap of making something better that shouldn't be there at all.

# Instructions

From first principles, assess what must be true to achieve NEXT_STEP and the tests that demonstrate that the essential functionality has been implemented to meet the applicable specs per TDD_F, TDD_TL, ARCH_TL. Define the minimal set of RED tests that the team will need to demonstrate completeness of NEXT_STEP objectives. 

If there are discrepancies between any of the reference documents or if you see an area where the requirements or code are "dumb" (could be implemented more cleanly or are not needed at all), after you have provided test specifications add a section called "RESOLUTION NEEDED" and detail your concerns or recommendations there. The "RESOLUTION NEEDED" section is optional. Only add it if you have a compelling reason to do so.
