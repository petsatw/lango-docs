# TASK
Please review this feature level TDD (F_TDD), determine which project documentation is most relevant to the scope of this request, also read in the codebase CURRENT_BUILD as the source of truth and determine from there how clear this TDD is. If we wanted to begin development right now, does this provide us with the information we need to implement this feature? Are there any conflicting specifications or references within this document (either internal to the document itself, or external to the project specifications and codebase more generally)
