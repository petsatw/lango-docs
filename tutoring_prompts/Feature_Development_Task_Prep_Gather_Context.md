Act as a world class mobile application architect

# CONTEXT

I am the lead developer tasked with delivering NEXT_STEP and after reviewing MY_CB, TDD_F, DP_F and ARCH_TL these are the questions that I need clarified in order to begin NEXT_STEP

[QUESTIONS FROM FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT_TASK_PREP_ASSESS_IMPACT.md]


# CRITERIA

Follow a first principles approach to the design and execution of this application including this task. Your goal first and foremost is to understand with as much clarity possible the objective and **what must be true** in order to meet the objectives. Everything else is a distraction. 

## Make your requirements less dumb.
- Every requirement, especially from “smart” people or organizations, should be rigorously questioned.
- Most errors come from bad assumptions that were never challenged.
- Always drive action with the purpose of finding the clearest path we know to the most vital part of the goal we are trying to achieve
- “Your requirements are definitely dumb; it’s just a matter of how dumb.”

## Try very hard to delete parts of the process or product.
- If something is not absolutely necessary, remove it.
- “If you’re not occasionally adding things back in, you’re not deleting enough.”
- Simplicity is a feature. Complexity is a bug.

## Optimize the design only after doing steps 1 and 2.
A common mistake is optimizing a part of the system that shouldn’t even exist.
Don’t fall into the trap of making something better that shouldn't be there at all.

## Speed Up the Process
First fix the what, then improve the how fast.

## Automate last.
Don’t automate something until it has been validated and optimized.
Musk: “One of the biggest mistakes I’ve made is automating something that should not exist.”

# INSTRUCTIONS

1) Carefully read in MY_CB, TDD_F, DP_F, ARCH_TL and NEXT_STEP. 

2) Be ruthless and adhere viscously to first principles so that we don't get too precious with our implementation of NEXT_STEP. Identify only the critical questions that are **In‑scope now** and then completely discard anything that can be **Explicitly deferred** based on the exact text in NEXT_STEP so the team has a crystal clear list of priorities to work from. 

3) Review the remaining essential questions and answer them in order to guide the team on NEXT_STEP. Provide them a high resolution of context detail so they can understand the reasoning behind your design decisions and how that design decision is most relevant to MY_CB. You need to understand, first and foremost, that the development team will be laser focused on implementing NEXT_STEP. They have no time to comb back through all of this documentation to find all the details they need. This set of instructions and guidance, coupled with NEXT_STEP will be what they use to perform 99% of their work on this task. So it needs to be as detailed as necessary and very, very clear. 

Assume first and foremost that are working directly with MY_CB code and have almost zero awareness of the technical details in any other documents other than these instructions. So provide them with instructions and detailed code snippets that are clear, actionable and are totally understandable within the context of the existing codebase (MY_CB). Leave no room for interpretation as to what changes need to be implemented. Avoid lazy instructions that would lead to unintentional overwrites or duplication.
