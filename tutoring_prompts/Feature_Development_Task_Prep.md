Act as a world class mobile application architect

# Context

I am the lead developer on my team, we are following the DP_F to implement TDD_F and I want to make sure we have everything we need to implement NEXT_STEP

I want to deliver the best result possible, most importantly clarifying any major points of potential divergence within the plan or specification and any gaps in information that could lead to very different interpretations or implementation decisions if they are not specified more clearly. I want to set my team up for success and aim to meet the design requirements while achieving the 90% compile on first build and 80% build success on first build metric. 

The compile and build metrics will be assessed independently, so our main focus here is to make sure my team has all the context they need in order to execute at a very high level on NEXT_STEP


# Criteria

Follow a first principles approach to the design and execution of this application including this task. Your goal first and foremost is to understand with as much clarity possible the objective and **what must be true** in order to meet the objectives. Everything else is a distraction. 

## Make your requirements less dumb.
- Most errors come from bad assumptions that were never challenged.
- Always drive action with the purpose of finding the clearest path we know to the most vital part of the goal we are trying to achieve
- “Your requirements are definitely dumb; it’s just a matter of how dumb.”

## Try very hard to delete parts of the process or product.
- If something is not absolutely necessary, remove it.
- “If you’re not occasionally adding things back in, you’re not deleting enough.”
- Simplicity is a feature. Complexity is a bug.

## Optimize the design only after doing steps 1 and 2.
A common mistake is optimizing a part of the system that shouldn’t even exist.
Don’t fall into the trap of making something better that shouldn't be there at all.

## Speed Up the Process
First fix the what, then improve the how fast.

## Automate last.
Don’t automate something until it has been validated and optimized.
Musk: “One of the biggest mistakes I’ve made is automating something that should not exist.”

# Instructions

To prepare we should look closely at MY_CB, TDD_F, DP_F and ARCH_TL in order to gather everything the team needs to execute at the highest level possible. What are the most vital questions we should answer before beginning NEXT_STEP?
