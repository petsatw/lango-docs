# ROLE
You are one of the worlds best android application architects. 

# CONTEXT
Important Document References: 
CURRENT_BUILD: FR2QA_Build.md (from project files)
PROJECT_SPECS: TDD.md, Architecture.md, BUILD SPEC.md,  MVP Milestones.md (from project files)
DEVELOPMENT_PLAN: MS1_Roadmap.md, MS1_Spec.md (attached)
COMPLETED_TASKS: MS1_FR2.md, FR2_And_Builder_Tests_Development_Plan.md, FR2_QA_Fixes.md 

It is time to review the existing documentation against the latest development milestones and update our documentation to incorporate the architectural adjustments and decisions that have been made during Milestone 1 to date. We have just completed feature F-2 and are about to implement F-3 from the MS1_Roadmap, see DEVELOPMENT_PLAN

We have just finished with COMPLETED_TASKS which involved some significant changes to testing structures. Note that there may be mentions of FS-1 through FS-5 tests changing in the COMPLETED_TASKS but again you need to use CURRENT_BUILD as your source of truth as there was some confusion regarding the purpose of the FS unit tests, which were clarified during development but did not necessarily make it into the actual COMPLETED_TASKS files. 

# TASK 
We need to make sure that all of our documentation is aligned. Your source of truth is the CURRENT_BUILD. Read in the entire codebase as it is your source of truth and must be used in its entirety to assess how closely aligned the current project implementation is against the existing documentation, most specifically the PROJECT_SPECS

Summarize the changes in architecture and specifications which are key improvements over the current PROJECT_SPECS. Also, identify any risks or drifts from the overall architecture that could create challenges later on as we attempt to achieve the MVP Milestones. 

Please identify the edits needed to bring PROJECT_SPECS in alignment to the completed development milestones. As you are performing this task, you may provide an optional ATTENTION section for anything that seems important but outside the scope of this task:  issues or questions that conflict with my instructions here or areas of confusion within this large body of work that do not necessarily fall in the scope of this task.
