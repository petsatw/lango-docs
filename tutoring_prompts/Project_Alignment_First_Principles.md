# CONTEXT
Before we detail out the next development sprint, we have an opportunity to review the high level sprint objectives against the development plan, specifications and architecture. This is our chance to approach things from first principles. When doing these reviews, I specifically do not want the team to assume that if there is a descrepancy between the objectives, plan, spec or architecture that it is the higher level documents that are "right". Instead I want to look against the overall objectives of the project and look at the discrepencies impartially to determine if they reveal a flaw in the design or a flaw in the execution/interpretation of the design? 

First Principles Ethos: 

## Make your requirements less dumb.
- Every requirement, especially from “smart” people or organizations, should be rigorously questioned.
- Most errors come from bad assumptions that were never challenged.
- Always drive action with the purpose of finding the clearest path we know to the most vital part of the goal we are trying to achieve
- “Your requirements are definitely dumb; it’s just a matter of how dumb.”

## Try very hard to delete parts of the process or product.
- If something is not absolutely necessary, remove it.
- “If you’re not occasionally adding things back in, you’re not deleting enough.”
- Simplicity is a feature. Complexity is a bug.

# TASK
Please help me draft an assignment for the team to perform this review. Keep it simple and clear, divided into two sections CONTEXT and TASKS. How best would you explain this as CONTEXT to the team and then what steps or considerations would recommend they undertake as TASKS to carry out this review? This is a digital review, do not introduce time as an element as the primary focus here is on actual thinking and examining and revising that need to take place to create as clear, aligned and accurate picture as possible so we can execute at a high level
